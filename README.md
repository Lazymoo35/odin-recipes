# odin-recipes

This project is a final task for the HTML section in The Odin Project foundational course, aimed to create
a website only for recipe hub.

Within the project I have made 6 pages that consists of 1 homepage and 5 recipe pages which are interlinked
through a directed hyperlink. In this pages are implemented some courses learned such as image insert,
paragraphs, interlinking, etc.

All credit and gratitude to The Odin Project for such easily understandable and complete-thorough courses
that I can easily participate and follow along.

Cheers.
