    <h1>Hot Spinach Artichoke Dip</h1>
    <p>This spinach artichoke dip is delicious. It's so cheesy and fragrant. If you don't like artichokes, don't worry â€” you'll never know they're in there! My only question is: Is it okay to eat it with a spoon right out of the dish?</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 block of cream cheese</li>
        <li>1 squeeze of mayonnaise</li>
        <li>1 bowl of grated parmesan, romano, and mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>1 clove of minced garlic</li>
        <li>1 pinch of dried basil, garlic salt, salt, and pepper</li>
        <li>1 can of artichoke hearts</li>
        <li>1 thawed and drained spinach</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Mix all the ingredients, except the mozzarella, together.</li>
        <li>Transfer the mixture to a prepared baking dish, top it with cheese.</li>
        <li>Bake the spinach artichoke dip in the preheated oven until bubbly.</li>
    </ol>
